the experience is the Users chance to engage in the website and see if they like it, ( how easy it is to use ) the user interface is them interaction with the design fields on the app 

What is Mock-Up?  
its like a blue blueprint for the blue print or a smaller scale for designing the app before working on it.

What is Mobile-First Design? 
Its designing the app by starting on a mobile design to make it easier for a better user experience. 

Who should be in control of the User Interface? 

I think this is an interesting question because I want to say the user is the people who are using it are in control, and I also think that the user interface can be the software devoloper because we are woking on the app and making it seem easy enough for the user to use and feel incontrol
